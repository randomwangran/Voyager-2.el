Migration your Org-roam to its updated version 2

* how to create new nodes?

  If the user create a headline within an Org-file, then the database
  will update the information accordingly.

  If user does not know where to put the new notes, a node will be
  generated using a new file just like what version-1 did.

* how to deal with headline
** headline is a http link
   It might be included `TODO` state
** headline is empty
** headline is a link to other notes

* how the time stamp is addressed?
  Is there a way

* how to deal with ID
  Better to explicitly set the id location
